                  <strong>Description:</strong> Independent E2E Automation
                  Project was a project which was build from the ground on
                  separated repository for team of 2 automation testers and one
                  developer for code review and guidance. The goal was to
                  automate as much manual tests as possible with as much as
                  possible scalability and maintainability also avoiding fragile
                  tests and flaky tests.

                    <br />
                    The project was a great success and it was best possible
                    learning experience for me and my team. We learned a lot
                    about E2E Automation and how to avoid flaky tests and how to
                    make tests more maintainable and scalable. We also learned a
                    lot about Cypress and how to use it to its full potential
                    using CI/CD, Docker and automate as much as possible.
